RocketNet
=========

Pure .NET implementation of the GNU Rocket client

GNU Rocket is an intuitive way of controlling eg. the thruster rockets of your doomsday device. As doomsday devices need to be controlled by software as evil as possible, I decided to go full .NET.

For more documentation and the editor, check the original: https://github.com/kusma/rocket/ - RocketNet maps the API to two classes (Device and Track) that stay true to the original way of using it.
